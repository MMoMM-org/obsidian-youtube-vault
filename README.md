# Obsidian Youtube Vaults

Welcome to my Youtube Vaults.

If you stumbled upon this project via GitHub, here is the link to my [English Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6VAMWpvpmv4jdk0iKPYMX2Qm6smbVIJW)
and here is the link to my [english blog](https://www.mmomm.org/en)


## Content

Please take a look at the [Changelog](Changelog.md) which should tell you what you can expect.

The codes in form of XX-YY connect the videos with the vault and my blog. You can search for them on youtube and on my blog.

The content of the vault is constantly growing, but if you want to roll back some episodes you can just download some old releases.
Just go to releases on the right side of the project and choose any version you like to download the obsidian-youtube-vaults zip file.

I hope you enjoy the content.


## Explanations

Explanations about the different Vaults can be found in the Youtube videos or on my  [Blog](https://www.mmomm.org/en).

Just come in some time.

All the best

Marcus


## PS!

Ignore everything outside the Vaults Directory, those files are just there to help me automatically create the zips for downloading.
